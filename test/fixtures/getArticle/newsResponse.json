We believe that people at Opel are the solution, not the problem.”</p>\n<p>He added that Opel management “became loose” during the transition to the new ownership, leading to a decline in performance.</p>\n<p>Karl-Thomas Neumann, former Opel boss, left shortly after the takeover.</p>\n<p>“In an automotive market which is so demanding, as soon as you have a little bit less focus on the business, things can go south very quickly,” Mr Tavares said.</p>\n<p>But he added: “I am very confident with everything I have seen so far of the turnround at Opel, I believe it is going to work.”</p>\n</body>",
